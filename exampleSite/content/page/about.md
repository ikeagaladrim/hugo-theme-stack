I'm a CyberSecurity professional with an itch for self-development, if that sounds a little woo-woo (the self development part) this is how I would define it.

Self-development is about enhancing, tuning, exploring, defining, failing, redefining and recognising all aspects of your ‘self’ - the feedback loop is always rewarding, finally I firmly believe self-development bleeds into all aspects of your professional life. Which should further encourage us all to explore a little more.

My plan is to use this corner of the internet to journal interesting finds, share ‘stuff’ I write elsewhere and finally document things that I know will be helpful to others, I also love;

* All things Productivity related - because, I need it
* Code (yeah right)
* and finally my curated leather jacket collection :)

Putting this site together was an easy decision, this quote by Annie Dillard sums my the motivation perfectly.
